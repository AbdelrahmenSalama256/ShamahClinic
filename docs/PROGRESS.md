# PROGRESS — Shamah backend + console (BK plan)

The brief, from the owner (2026-10-22):

> اعمل باك اند للموقع بتاع شامه حتي لو ب nodejs عشان ميبقاش الاعتماد علي ووردبريس خالص محتاج اشيله
> واعمل داش بورد تكون ثيرد بارتي اضيف من المحتوي للموقع والماركتينج يتابع حاجته من عليها + ال SEO كذلك
>
> Build a backend for the Shamah site (Node.js is fine) so there is **no dependency on WordPress at all** —
> it is being removed. Add a dashboard that is neither paid nor free-SaaS ("من صنعي أنا"), that carries
> site-wide statistics like WordPress did, and that holds everything the site feeds that nobody currently
> sees — **leads, configurations**. Marketing must be able to work from it. SEO too.

Decisions already taken, do not re-open them: the console is this repo at its own path with its own layout
(no site header); the database is MySQL/MariaDB because cPanel hosts it; content is imported locally now and
loaded into the console once it exists; `D:\shamah` is left alone.

## Resume protocol (do this first, every time)
1. Read this file, then `git log --oneline -20`. Continue at the first unchecked row; never redo a `[x]` row.
2. Work only in `D:\shamah_cms` on branch `cms-clean`. **Never push. Never touch `main`. Never touch
   `D:\shamah`** (the live site, and another session's `admin-restore` branch lives there too).
3. Stage explicit paths — never `git add -A`. One commit per finished row, hash on the row.
4. Secrets: print variable **names** only, never values. `.env.local` / `.env.test` are sourced, never echoed.
5. `data/wp/*.json` and `public/wp/*` are the frozen WordPress backup (92 articles, 4 offers, 56 result
   stories). They are read-only until BK-7 imports them and are **never deleted**.
6. Mutating CLI commands default to dry-run; they only act with `--apply`/`--force`.
7. Tests run against `shamah_cms_test` only — `src/lib/db/guard.ts` refuses anything not ending in `_test`.

## Gates (all four must be green before a row is marked done)
`npm run typecheck` · `npm run lint` · `npx vitest run` · `npm run build`
`npm run doctor` says whether the machine is ready. Local DB: start with `npm run db:local:start`
(port 3307, loopback only — see `docs/LOCAL-MARIADB.md`).

`npm run build` needs outbound network: `next/font/google` fetches Montserrat and Readex Pro at compile time
(`src/lib/fonts.ts`). Offline it fails with `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND fonts.googleapis.com` — that is the
environment, not the code. Self-hosting the two fonts would remove the dependency; do that only if deploys
turn out to need it.

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (commit hash on the row).

## BK-0 — clean room
- [x] 0.1 New tree from the last clean site commit (`e3c19e3`), branch `cms-clean`, deps installed,
      `D:\shamah` verified untouched
- [x] 0.2 Baseline gate: `lint`, `typecheck`, `vitest` and `next build` are green. `next build` once failed at
      page-data for two separate reasons: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` was unset (fixed — `.env.example` now
      documents it) and, while this shell had no DNS, `next/font/google` could not reach the font CDN.
      With network back it builds clean — BK-3's commit `08b790e` ran the full gate set.
- [x] 0.3 This ledger; the dead Payload ledger archived as `docs/PROGRESS-payload-archived.md`

## BK-1 — the database that will actually be deployed
- [x] 1.1 Portable MariaDB 11.4.13 on `D:\mariadb`, loopback 127.0.0.1:3307, `my.ini` + start/stop scripts — `a1afdd9`
- [x] 1.2 `npm run db:local:provision` creates `shamah_cms` + `shamah_cms_test`, one app user per database,
      and writes `.env.local` / `.env.test` (names printed, values never) — `a1afdd9`

## BK-2 — schema, migrations, typed access
- [x] 2.1 Six migrations, 39 tables: auth, content, SEO, leads, publish, stats — `a1afdd9`
- [x] 2.2 Checksummed migration runner, dry-run by default, refuses an edited applied file — `a1afdd9`
- [x] 2.3 Kysely types for all 39 tables; `MysqlDialect` on the callback `mysql2` pool (the promise pool
      never resolves — see the note in `src/lib/db/index.ts`) — `a1afdd9`
- [x] 2.4 `Json`/`JsonOr` column types + `json()`: MariaDB JSON is LONGTEXT with a `json_valid()` check, so a
      raw object arrives as `key = 'value'` SQL text and dies on the constraint. Writes are strings, reads are values — `a1afdd9`
- [x] 2.5 `src/lib/db/schema.test.ts` — 8 tests, including a drift check that compares every column and every
      SQL default against `types.ts` — `a1afdd9`
- [x] 2.6 `npm run doctor` — env names, connectivity, migration state, checksums, content counts — `a1afdd9`

## BK-3 — auth core
- [x] 3.1 bcryptjs cost 12 with a real decoy hash, so an unknown address and a wrong password cost the same and
      the answer never says which half was wrong; passwords over bcrypt's 72-byte truncation point are refused
      by policy. Opaque 32-byte session tokens — only the SHA-256 hex is stored, the raw one exists in the
      cookie alone — sliding 14-day expiry, 5-minute `last_seen` throttle, renewal under 2 days. — `08b790e`
- [x] 3.2 httpOnly + SameSite=Lax session cookie (Secure wherever the request is https, which `cookiesRequireSecure`
      decides from the request URL so cPanel's proxy terminates TLS correctly), readable CSRF cookie, per-session
      CSRF token, and two login budgets per 15-minute window (8 per email, 25 per IP) via `login_attempts` — `08b790e`
- [x] 3.3 `guard()` is the one enforcement path: `authenticate()` → csrf → `can(resource, action, scope)` →
      must-change-password → zod → execute → one audit row. Permission before body parsing, so an unauthorized
      caller gets 403 and learns nothing about the payload. Proven by `tests/auth.test.ts`. — `08b790e`
- [x] 3.4 `npm run owner:create` / `npm run owner:reset`: dry-run until `--apply`, the password comes from a
      muted raw-mode prompt or `--password-stdin` and is never a CLI argument, and only variable names are
      printed. `owner:create` grants the Owner role and writes a `cli:owner:*` audit row. — `08b790e`

## BK-4 — roles
- [ ] 4.1 Seed Owner / Admin / Editor / SEO / Marketer / Viewer with `role_permissions` scopes
- [ ] 4.2 Lead field redaction by role (phone/email hidden from Viewer, etc.)
- [ ] 4.3 Test: every write endpoint answers **403, not 400**, when the caller lacks the permission — i.e.
      permission is checked before the body is parsed

## BK-5 — the console at its own path
- [ ] 5.1 `/console/**` with its own root layout — the site header, footer and providers must not appear
- [ ] 5.2 Exclude `console` from the `[lang]` rewrite in `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 renamed `middleware` to `proxy`;
      the current matcher would otherwise send `/console` to `/ar/console`)
- [ ] 5.3 Login, shell, and AR + EN with RTL, light + dark

## BK-6 — content CRUD + publish
- [ ] 6.1 Articles, offers, pages, lists (specialists, branches, FAQ, treatments, results, nav), settings
- [ ] 6.2 Draft → publish in one transaction (draft columns copy to `pub_*`, a revision is written, rollback works)
- [ ] 6.3 ONE read path for the site: the database, with the baked `data/wp` snapshot as fallback
- [ ] 6.4 Trash + never-delete: soft delete, restore, and versions that are never garbage-collected

## BK-7 — cut WordPress out
- [ ] 7.1 Fresh WP dump into a NEW timestamped folder (never overwriting `data/wp/*.json`)
- [ ] 7.2 Import 92+92 articles, 4 offers, 56 result stories with slugs preserved (`legacy_id` set)
- [ ] 7.3 Remove every live WordPress read (`src/lib/wp/http.ts`, `src/lib/wp/index.ts:119`) and `sync:wp`
- [ ] 7.4 Prove it: zero requests to `shamaclinics.com` from a cold render of every public route

## BK-8 — marketing
- [ ] 8.1 Leads persisted (today `/api/v1/lead` only composes a WhatsApp text and keeps counters in memory)
- [ ] 8.2 Status pipeline, notes, assignee, CSV export, idempotency key
- [ ] 8.3 CTAs + follow-up actions, click tracking, optional Google Sheets outbox

## BK-9 — SEO
- [ ] 9.1 SEO center per entity per locale (title, description, OG, hreflang, JSON-LD, head tags)
- [ ] 9.2 Redirects table honoured at the edge of the site, with a loop guard
- [ ] 9.3 sitemap.xml + robots.txt generated from the database, both locales

## BK-10 — statistics
- [ ] 10.1 First-party `stats_events` capture (no third-party script required), bot filter, hashed visitor id
- [ ] 10.2 Daily rollups + referrers + CTA clicks, and the console dashboard that reads them

## BK-11 — deploy
- [ ] 11.1 cPanel + MySQL procedure: `DATABASE_URL` vs discrete vars, migrations on deploy, Node app setup
- [ ] 11.2 Import the local content into the deployed database (the owner's plan: build locally, then load it up)

## BK-12 — housekeeping
- [ ] 12.1 Git/GitHub tidy in `D:\shamah`: branch inventory, bundles for the dead lines of work, prune stray
      worktrees, decide on `psql/` and `start-server.bat` — nothing deleted without a bundle first
- [ ] 12.2 **Security warning for the owner**: the `admin-restore` branch in `D:\shamah` ships `/admin` and
      `/api/sitedash/{config,leads}` with no authentication of any kind (no session, no token, no proxy guard).
      It must not reach a deployment as it stands.

## Known gaps / notes
- `docs/IMAGES.md` and `docs/SEO-SOURCE.md` referenced by the old brief do not exist.
- The old Neon/Postgres/Vercel-Blob environment belongs to the abandoned Payload attempt; this build does not
  use it. `.env.example` documents what this stack actually reads.

### Things MariaDB and Kysely do differently (each one cost debugging time)
- **No `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (cols) DO NOTHING`.** That is Postgres syntax; Kysely's
  `onConflict().doNothing()` emits it and MariaDB rejects the statement. Use check-then-insert —
  `assignRole()` in `src/lib/auth/users.ts:105` does.
- **JSON columns read back already parsed.** MariaDB stores them as LONGTEXT with a `json_valid()` check and
  `mysql2` type-casts on read, so `after_json` is an object, not a string. Write with `json(value)`, read
  without `JSON.parse` — an assertion that parsed twice threw `"[object Object]" is not valid JSON`.
- **`Database` must not extend `Record<string, unknown>`.** The index signature collapses `keyof Database` to
  `string`, and every qualified join reference then infers as `never` ("argument not assignable to never").
  Fixed in `src/lib/db/types.ts` in `08b790e`; schema drift is caught by `src/lib/db/schema.test.ts`.

### Console auth surface (BK-5 builds the UI on this)
- `POST /api/console/auth` login · `DELETE` logout · `GET /api/console/auth/me` · `POST /api/console/auth/password`.
- The core (`src/lib/auth/*`) takes a plain `Request` and returns a `Response` — no Next imports — so it runs
  under vitest without a server and the route files are one-liners. Keep it that way.
- `npm run doctor` reports `users — 0 rows` until an Owner is created; the dev database still has no real
  account (`shamah_cms`, not `_test`).
